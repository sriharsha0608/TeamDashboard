# TeamDashboard
<p>I have used ReactJS framework to develop TeamDashboard SPA.</p>
<p>To create a react app follow the below commands</p>
<pre>npx create-react-app team-dashboard</pre>
<p>Now go the directory of the app</p>
<pre>cd team-dashboard</pre>
<p>Install the necessary dependencies you require. I've used bootstrap for my CSS.</p>
<pre>npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap</pre>
<p>Now, start building your application. Once, you're donw building the app, you can run it by using the below command</p>
<pre>npm start</pre>
